Familiarize yourself => MOST IMPORTANT

-------------------ZULIP--------------------
Claiming a issue: simply post a comment that says @zulipbot claim  => only for zulip/zulip and zulip/zulip-terminal
issues resolved by  running ./tools/provision (from /srv/zulip) inside the Vagrant guest or equivalently vagrant provision from outside

RUNNING ENVIROMENT
./tools/provision
source /srv/zulip-py3-venv/bin/activate
./tools/run-dev

AFTER COMMIT 
tools/setup-git-repo  => linting after code change in a file 
tools/lint => for all files
./tools/run-dev => live terminal which will show runtime/backend errors

ERRORS: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/setup-recommended.html  [LAST SECTION]

LINTING:
./tools/test-all
./tools/lint zerver/models/__init__.py 							# Lint the file you just changed
./tools/test-backend zerver.tests.test_markdown.MarkdownTest.test_inline_youtube
./tools/test-backend MarkdownTest 							# Run `test-backend --help` for more options
./tools/test-js-with-node util
./tools/test-run-dev
./tools/test-tools
./tools/check-frontend-i18n

linting is also automatically done whenever we will commit some changes
