> Rules of thumb
. if issue is less than 20 lines of code then it will be issue without a ticket and you can directly PR on those issue 
. For ticket issues you need to create ticket by talking to contributors on developer channel or contributors channel
. access the devapp at: localhost:8065
. If there's already an existing bug in Jira, it will be linked back to the GitHub issue so you can track when it gets fixed.
