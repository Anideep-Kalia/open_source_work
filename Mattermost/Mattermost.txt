STARTING SERVER
> localhost:8065
> cd server => make run-server
> test above => curl http://localhost:8065/api/v4/system/ping
> make run || make stop-server => make stop-docker

> Guilds and channel part:  
. Now for guild and other channels can be found at Channels page and on the left side you can see different guilds like web-app, sever and so on....
. Weekly meetings also happend at contributor channel at 9:00 every Wednesday => look out for this if you wanted

> In thank-you channel we have GitHub profiles of flagship contributors so can check that out

> see bugs-channel and try to fix them or help people out


 



> Rules of thumb
. if issue is less than 20 lines of code then it will be issue without a ticket and you can directly PR on those issue 
. For ticket issues you need to create ticket by talking to contributors on developer channel or contributors channel
. access the devapp at: localhost:8065
. If there's already an existing bug in Jira, it will be linked back to the GitHub issue so you can track when it gets fixed.


> cybersecurity programs (might be irrelevant)
. https://hackerone.com/mattermost     => can try after couples of PR
.
