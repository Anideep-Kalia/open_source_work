Removing profile pictures as admin
Is there a way for admins to delete the current profile picture of a user?
I haven't found an option for it in mmctl or the admin interface.

We removed the profile.png in the user folder as a quick solution. But it feels like there should be a way without requiring ash access to the server.

Any user that has edit_other_users permission (like a system admin) could do it through the REST API: https://api.mattermost.com/#tag/users/operation/SetDefaultProfileImage

We'd accept a PR to add that functionality to mmctl if someone wanted to contribute it
